        <h2>PowerShell Saturday</h2>
        <p>We are considering organizing a PowerShell Saturday (a one-day, small-format technical event from 9am-5pm) in the
            Chicago area. Before we spend a lot of time and energy organizing the event and making commitments, we want to
            gauge interest. If you are interested in attending, presenting or assisting with the event (planning/organizing
            or running it), please join the mailing list below. If we do proceed with organizing the event, we will reach
            out to those interested via email. Note: it would take about 6 months to organize the event, so the earliest
            it would happen would be near the end of 2018. </p>
        <h2>PowerShell Chicago User Group</h2>
        <p>We would like to to gauge interest for a PowerShell User Group in the Chicagoland area. If you are interested in
            joining, or helping organize, a yet to be formed PowerShell Chicago User Group, please sign up to the mailing
            list below.</p>
